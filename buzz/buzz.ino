/*  Buzzer Prank

    A small and simple prank. It's a buzzer that will buzz a random
    number of times in a two second period, this burst will occur 
    randomly every few minutes.

    The reason we designed it to buzz a random number of times in a
    limited (2 second) window was to limit the time people have to
    locate it until it stops. Otherwise if a random number of same
    length buzzes would occur, it would be buzz for a greater time
    overall, giving more time to track.

    Uses a disconnected ('floating') analog pin to set a random
    seed which makes the 'random' numbers more random. Not really
    needed, mostly just there to be extra.
